# VibeLab - Improved Interface Branch

This branch contains the completely redesigned VibeLab interface developed through iterative user feedback.

## Key Features

### üéØ Core Functionality
- **Blinded Evaluation**: Technique names hidden during ranking to prevent bias
- **Auto-next Workflow**: Automatically loads new batches after submission
- **Inline Technique Reveal**: Shows techniques directly below ranked SVGs
- **Live Analytics**: Real-time performance charts and statistics

### ‚å®Ô∏è Multiple Navigation Options
- **Arrow Keys (‚Üê ‚Üí ‚Üë ‚Üì)**: Navigate between SVGs in grid
- **Letter Keys (a, b, c, d)**: Direct selection of specific SVGs
- **Number Keys (1-4)**: Rank the currently selected SVG
- **Mouse Click**: Click to select SVGs
- **Drag & Drop**: Drag SVGs directly to ranking slots
- **Enter**: Submit current ranking
- **R**: Reset rankings

### üìä Analytics Dashboard
- Win rate charts with Chart.js
- Session statistics tracking
- Technique performance comparison
- Evaluation timing metrics

### üé® Design Principles
- **Visual Clarity**: Large SVGs (280px) for detailed evaluation
- **Minimal Cognitive Load**: Clean, distraction-free interface
- **Immediate Feedback**: Clear visual states for all interactions
- **Research-Focused**: Optimized for rapid evaluation workflows

## File Structure
- `index.html` - Main interface (complete version)
- `archive/` - Previous iterations for reference

## Development History
This interface went through 15+ iterations based on user feedback:
1. Initial blinded evaluation concept
2. Multiple zoom/inspection approaches tested
3. Layout optimizations (2x2 grid, bottom ranking)
4. Drag & drop refinements
5. Keyboard navigation enhancements
6. Final integration of all navigation methods

## Next Steps
- Backend integration with LLM APIs
- Data persistence and export
- Multi-user evaluation sessions
- Participant onboarding flow
