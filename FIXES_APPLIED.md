# VibeLab Fixes Applied

## Main Issue Fixed: Loading Overlay Stuck on "Starting generation queue..."

### Root Causes Identified:
1. Potential infinite loops in generation queue
2. Missing hideLoading() calls in error scenarios
3. No timeout mechanisms for stuck operations

### Fixes Applied:

#### 1. Generation Timeout Protection
- Added 5-minute timeout to prevent infinite generation loops
- Forces stop with warning message if timeout reached
- Debug logging for generation start times

#### 2. Enhanced Pause Functionality
- Immediate `hideLoading()` call when generation is paused
- Proper state cleanup when pausing

#### 3. Loading Overlay Safety Mechanisms
- 30-second auto-hide timeout for stuck loading overlays
- Console warnings when auto-hiding stuck overlays
- Better error handling in generation loop

#### 4. Improved Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks around generation loop
- Proper cleanup in finally blocks
- Better error messages for failed generations

#### 5. Code Structure Fixes
- Fixed syntax errors in JavaScript
- Added missing method definitions
- Ensured proper class structure

### Files Modified:
- `enhanced-app.js`: Main fixes applied
- `index.html`: Attempted to fix but system-level duplication issues persist

### Testing Recommendations:
1. Test the start/pause generation buttons
2. Verify loading overlay appears and disappears correctly
3. Test timeout mechanisms with long-running operations
4. Check console for debug messages and warnings

### Remaining Issues:
- File duplication at system level (appears to be environment-specific)
- HTML file structure needs manual cleanup if duplication persists
