# VibeLab Enhancement Test Plan

## System Status
All major enhancements have been implemented:
- ✅ Parallel generation (fixed Promise.race implementation)
- ✅ Database persistence (SQLite backend)
- ✅ Multi-step conversations
- ✅ Data migration tools
- ✅ Custom prompt design (no hardcoded examples)
- ✅ Dynamic prompt modifiers (8 techniques)

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Start the System
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend
python llm_backend.py

# Terminal 2: Start frontend
python -m http.server 8000

# Browser: Navigate to
http://localhost:8000
```

### 2. Test Parallel Generation
1. Create experiment with 2+ prompts and 2+ models
2. Set "Max parallel" to 3
3. Start generation and verify multiple SVGs generate simultaneously
4. Check backend.log for parallel execution

### 3. Test Database Persistence
1. Create and run an experiment
2. Refresh the page
3. Click "Load Experiment" - your experiment should be available
4. Verify data persists between sessions

### 4. Test Multi-Step Conversations
1. Enable "Multi-step conversations" checkbox
2. Set max steps to 3
3. Run generation
4. Check that each prompt goes through iterative refinement

### 5. Test Prompt Modifiers
1. Select different variation techniques:
   - Role-play
   - Chain of Thought
   - Expert Persona
   - Step-by-Step
   - Constraint Focus
   - Creative Inspiration
   - Few-Shot
2. Compare results against baseline

### 6. Test Data Migration
1. If you have old localStorage data:
   - Click "Migrate localStorage Data"
   - Verify migration report
   - Check that old experiments appear in database

## Known Issues
- None currently identified

## Next Steps
1. Implement Phase 4: LLM-Consortium integration
2. Add statistical analysis for prompt technique comparison
3. Enhance UI for experiment comparison
4. Add export functionality for research paper data
