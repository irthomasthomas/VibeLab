# SVG Drag-and-Drop Fix Summary

## Problem
SVG images were changing appearance/color during drag-and-drop reordering in the Evaluation tab.

## Root Cause
The original implementation used `innerHTML` to insert SVG content, which caused the browser to re-parse the SVG during DOM manipulation operations, leading to rendering inconsistencies.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Modified `createSVGItem` method in app.js:**
   - Changed from using template literals and innerHTML for the entire SVG container
   - Now creates DOM elements programmatically
   - Parses SVG content once and clones the SVG node to preserve its structure
   - Only uses innerHTML for non-SVG content (model info and variation text)

2. **Enhanced CSS in style.css:**
   - Added `will-change: transform` to optimize drag performance
   - Added `transform: translateZ(0)` to force hardware acceleration
   - Added `contain: layout style` to optimize SVG rendering
   - Disabled pointer events on SVG container during drag

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Create an experiment with multiple prompts
2. Generate several SVGs with different models/variations
3. Go to the Evaluation tab
4. Drag and drop SVGs to reorder them
5. Verify that SVG appearance remains consistent during and after dragging

## Next Steps
Continue with Phase 2 priorities:
- Begin modularization of app.js
- Create controller modules starting with GenerationQueueController.js
