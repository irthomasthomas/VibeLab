VibeLab is a promising tool with a clever core concept: using SVG generation as a rapid, visual proxy for evaluating prompt engineering techniques. To help it reach its full potential for both researchers and the public, a focused refactoring effort is needed. Here's a comprehensive analysis of its current state and a proposed strategy for improvement:

**I. Architectural Flaws and Analysis**

The current VibeLab application, primarily within `app.js` and `style.css`, exhibits several common issues found in rapidly developed prototypes:

1.  **Monolithic Frontend (`app.js`):**
    *   **Issue:** The `VibeLab` class acts as a "God object," handling UI rendering for all tabs, state management (experiments, queue, rankings, templates), API interactions, event listening, and core business logic.
    *   **Impact:** This makes the codebase difficult to maintain, debug, test, and extend. Changes in one area can unintentionally break others. Onboarding new contributors is challenging.

2.  **Direct DOM Manipulation & Tight Coupling:**
    *   **Issue:** Extensive use of `document.getElementById`, `createElement`, `innerHTML` is directly intertwined with business logic.
    *   **Impact:** UI components are not reusable. Logic is tightly coupled to specific HTML structures, making UI changes brittle. Testing UI and logic in isolation is hard.

3.  **Centralized but Unstructured State Management:**
    *   **Issue:** All application state (`this.currentExperiment`, `this.generationQueue`, etc.) is managed as properties of the single `VibeLab` instance.
    *   **Impact:** Tracking state changes is difficult. Race conditions and inconsistencies can arise, especially with asynchronous operations. The "SVG images change color/something on drag-n-drop" bug is likely a symptom of state and rendering being improperly managed during re-renders.

4.  **API Interaction Issues:**
    *   **Issue:** Some API calls (e.g., for template management in `saveCurrentAsTemplate`, `createNewTemplate`) use `fetch` directly with hardcoded URLs, bypassing any central `ApiService.js`.
    *   **Impact:** Inconsistent error handling, difficulty in managing base URLs or authentication tokens, and code duplication.

5.  **Data Persistence Strategy:**
    *   **Issue:** `localStorage` is used for `saveExperiment` and `loadExperiment` on the client-side, while the backend already has database capabilities for experiments. The `prompt_manager.py` on the backend uses a JSON file for templates, despite having `DatabaseManager`.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for data loss if browser data is cleared. `localStorage` is not robust for critical research data. JSON file storage for templates is not scalable or reliable (prone to corruption, race conditions). Creates multiple sources of truth.

6.  **CSS Organization:**
    *   **Issue:** `style.css` shows some duplication and could benefit from a more modular approach (e.g., BEM, utility classes, or CSS-in-JS if a framework is adopted).
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to specificity issues, making styling harder to manage and refactor.

7.  **Limited Error Handling and User Feedback:**
    *   **Issue:** While `error_display_system.js` is mentioned, robust, user-friendly error handling and feedback for ongoing operations (e.g., generation queue progress) seem limited.
    *   **Impact:** Poor user experience, difficulty for users to understand what went wrong or what the system is doing.

**II. Proposed Refactoring Strategy**

A phased approach is recommended:

**Phase 1: Immediate Fixes & Vanilla JS Enhancements (Stabilization & Basic Modularization)**

1.  **Fix Critical Bugs (from `TODO.md` and analysis):**
    *   **`+ Add Custom Technique` Button:** Implement the `addCustomTechnique()` method.
        ```javascript
        // In VibeLab class
        addCustomTechnique() {
            const container = document.getElementById('prompt-techniques-container');
            const techniqueItem = document.createElement('div');
            techniqueItem.className = 'prompt-technique-item';
            // Note: Ensure unique IDs for inputs if needed, or manage via parent
            techniqueItem.innerHTML = `
                <input type="checkbox" class="technique-enabled" checked>
                <input type="text" class="technique-name" placeholder="Custom Technique Name">
                <textarea class="technique-template" placeholder="{prompt} (e.g., Your instruction: {prompt})">{prompt}</textarea>
                <button class="remove-technique" onclick="this.parentElement.remove()">Ã—</button>
                <span class="technique-type">(custom)</span>
            `;
            container.appendChild(techniqueItem);
        }
        // Ensure event listener is correctly attached in initializeEventListeners:
        // document.getElementById('add-prompt-technique').addEventListener('click', () => this.addCustomTechnique());
        ```
    *   **`Clear Queue` Button:** Ensure it stops generation if active, clears the queue array, and updates UI.
        ```javascript
        // In VibeLab class
        clearQueue() {
            if (!confirm('Are you sure you want to clear the generation queue? This action cannot be undone.')) return;

            this.isGenerating = false; // Stop any ongoing generation loops
            this.generationQueue = [];
            this.updateQueueDisplay();
            document.getElementById('start-queue').disabled = true;
            document.getElementById('pause-queue').disabled = true;
            document.getElementById('queue-status').textContent = 'Queue cleared. No experiment loaded.';
            if (this.currentExperiment) {
                 this.currentExperiment.results = []; // Also clear results if they are tied to the queue
            }
            vlInfo('Queue Cleared', 'The generation queue has been successfully cleared.'); // Example user feedback
        }
        ```
    *   **SVG Drag-n-Drop Bug:** This is likely due to re-rendering issues. A temporary fix might involve ensuring SVGs are not re-parsed or their inner content modified during DOM reordering. A more robust fix comes with proper state management and VDOM (Phase 2). For now, ensure that when `reorderItems` and `updateRankingsFromDOM` are called, they only change the order and rank badge, not the SVG content itself.

2.  **Modularize `app.js` (Core Logic Separation):**
    *   Break down `VibeLab` into smaller, more focused classes/modules (even as plain JS files initially):
        *   `ExperimentSetupController.js`: Handles logic for the "Experiment Setup" tab.
        *   `GenerationQueueController.js`: Manages the "Generation Queue" tab, SVG generation process.
        *   `EvaluationController.js`: Handles "Evaluation" tab, ranking logic.
        *   `ResultsController.js`: Manages the "Results" tab.
        *   `TemplateController.js`: Handles template modal and interactions.
        *   `AppController.js` (or a new `main.js`): Orchestrates these modules, handles tab switching and shared state (initially, could pass `this.currentExperiment` etc., or use a simple pub/sub event bus).
    *   This separation will make the code easier to navigate and manage.

3.  **Centralize API Calls:**
    *   Ensure *all* backend interactions go through `ApiService.js`. Refactor template save/delete methods in `app.js` (soon to be `TemplateController.js`) to use it.
    *   Enhance `ApiService.js` to handle base URLs, common headers, and provide consistent error parsing and propagation.

4.  **Backend Data Storage Consolidation:**
    *   **Prompt Templates:** Modify `prompt_manager.py` to use the `DatabaseManager` to store templates in SQLite instead of `prompts.json`. Update FastAPI endpoints accordingly.
    *   **Experiments:** Phase out client-side `localStorage` for `saveExperiment`/`loadExperiment`. These should primarily interact with backend endpoints that save/load experiment data (including rankings) to the database. `localStorage` could be used for *temporary unsaved draft* state only.

5.  **Improve User Feedback:**
    *   Implement more visual cues for loading states (e.g., when generating, loading templates).
    *   Use the `vlError`, `vlWarning`, `vlInfo` (from `error_display_system.js`) more consistently for user feedback.

**III. Extended TODO List (Incorporating User Feedback & Professional Experience)**

**Critical / High Priority (Addressing `TODO.md` + Core Issues):**

*   **[BUGFIX] `+ Add Custom Technique` button functionality.** (Covered in Phase 1)
*   **[BUGFIX] `Clear Queue` button functionality.** (Covered in Phase 1)
*   **[BUGFIX] Evaluation: Debug SVG visual changes during drag-n-drop.** (Initial investigation in Phase 1, full fix with state management in Phase 2)
*   **[REFACTOR] Modularize `app.js` into smaller controllers/modules.** (Phase 1)
*   **[REFACTOR] Centralize all API calls via `ApiService.js`.** (Phase 1)
*   **[BACKEND] Migrate prompt templates from JSON file to database.** (Phase 1)
*   **[DATA] Shift primary experiment save/load from `localStorage` to backend DB.** (Phase 1)
*   **[UI/UX] LLM Consortium Models Section:**
    *   Short-term: Make it a collapsible section.
    *   Allow selection from *pre-saved* consortiums (backend needs an endpoint to list these from `consortium_configs` table).
    *   Defer complex UI for *creating* new consortiums or move it to a dedicated settings page/modal later.
*   **[FEATURE] Model Selection:**
    *   Backend: Create an endpoint to list available models from `llm models list` (or equivalent Python API introspection).
    *   Frontend: Fetch this list and implement a type-to-filter/autocomplete dropdown for model selection.
*   **[UX] Robust Error Handling & User Notifications:** Implement and consistently use `error_display_system.js` for user-facing messages. Show loading indicators.

**Medium Priority (Enhancements & Researcher Needs):**

*   **[UI/UX REFACTOR] Combine Generation Queue and Evaluation Tabs:** (As suggested in `TODO.md`)
    *   After "Create Experiment," navigate to a unified "Run & Evaluate" view.
    *   Display a main progress bar for the entire queue (expandable to show detailed list).
    *   Dynamically populate the SVG evaluation area (grid/carousel) as generations complete.
*   **[UX] Auto-start Generation Queue:** Add a checkbox in "Generation Settings" for "Start generation immediately after experiment creation." If checked, call `startGeneration()` after `createExperiment()` completes.
*   **[UX] Shuffle Generation Display Order (Evaluation):** Add an option to shuffle the SVGs within each prompt group before displaying them for ranking to reduce order bias. The shuffled order should be stable for that evaluation session.
*   **[FEATURE] Per-Prompt Ranking Persistence:** Ensure rankings are saved with the experiment data to the backend.
*   **[FEATURE] Selective Re-generation:** Allow users to select specific failed or low-quality SVGs and re-queue them for generation.
*   **[ACCESSIBILITY] Basic WCAG Compliance:** Ensure keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes for custom controls, and decent color contrast.
*   **[FEATURE] Export Results:** Enhance `exportResults()`:
    *   Ensure it includes all relevant data (ranks, full prompt text, variation details, model, SVG content, timestamps, experiment name).
    *   Consider offering CSV export in addition to JSONL.
*   **[PERFORMANCE] Optimize SVG Rendering:** If lists become very long, consider virtual scrolling or lazy loading for the SVG grid.

**Low Priority / Future Enhancements (Public-Facing & Advanced Research):**

*   **[UI/UX] Modern & Engaging UI Design:** Professional design polish for public appeal.
*   **[FEATURE] User Authentication & Accounts:** For users to save experiments to the backend under their profile.
*   **[FEATURE] "Share Experiment" Functionality:** Allow users to share experiment setups or (anonymized) results.
*   **[FEATURE] Responsive Design:** Ensure good usability on tablets and mobile devices.
*   **[CONTENT] Tutorials & Onboarding:** Guide new users on prompt engineering and VibeLab usage.
*   **[ANALYSIS] Advanced Statistical Analysis:**
    *   Integrate more formal statistical tests (e.g., Friedman test for rankings, pairwise comparisons).
    *   Calculate inter-rater reliability if multiple evaluators are supported.
*   **[FEATURE] Experiment Versioning/Cloning:** Allow users to iterate on experiments.
*   **[FEATURE] Community Features:** (For public site) Prompt library, sharing techniques, leaderboards.
