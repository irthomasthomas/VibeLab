# VibeLab Current Status

## What's Working
- Backend APIs are functional (/api/experiments and /api/models return data)
- Database persistence is working
- Custom prompt interface is in place
- Multi-step conversation system is implemented

## Known Issues Being Fixed
1. Model persistence between sessions - registerModel function needs proper placement
2. Saved experiments not showing - listStoredExperiments needs to be called properly

## Quick Fix Instructions
To manually fix the remaining issues:

1. Ensure registerModel is only inside the VibeLab class
2. Ensure listStoredExperiments is inside the VibeLab class
3. Call this.loadSavedModels() in constructor
4. Call this.listStoredExperiments() when Results tab is opened

## Testing
```bash
python llm_backend.py
python -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000
```
