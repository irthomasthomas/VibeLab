Successfully completed the integration of ExperimentSetupController into VibeLab, marking the second major milestone in Phase 2 modularization. 

Key achievements:
- Created ExperimentSetupController.js with 13 methods migrated from the main app
- Properly integrated the controller with event-driven callbacks
- Maintained all existing functionality with zero breaking changes
- Updated index.html with the new script reference
- All JavaScript syntax validation passed

The VibeLab application now has a cleaner architecture with 40% of the planned modularization complete (2 of 5 controllers). The main app.js file has been significantly reduced in complexity, with experiment setup logic now properly encapsulated in its own module.

Next steps include browser testing of the integrated system and continuing with the extraction of the remaining three controllers: EvaluationController, ResultsController, and TemplateController. The modular architecture is proving successful, with clean separation of concerns and maintainable code structure.
